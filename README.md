This is the Git-Hub Repository of the Team - LearningtooDeep for the Deep Learning
Competition on CIFAR-10 classification conducted in Kaggle and In this Repository I
have included the Codebase in the form of a Jupyter Notebook File, and I have included
Report as well.

Along with that I have also included the DL.csv file which was our prediction on the
competition which achieved an accuracy of 85.38%. Even when you run the code that is 
provided you will also achieve the same CSV file and gives the same prediction.

For reference I have also attached the questionnaire of the project provided by the
professor and this is a ReadME file for explaining what exactly does this Repository
Contains.
